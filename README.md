Changes in Global temperature over the past 130 years

source: NASA Goddard Institue for Space Studies surface temperature analysis: http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/: data withdrawn from http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts.txt

The data records global temperature anomolies by comparing monthly temperature from 1880 to the present to a base period from 1951-1980. The numbers in data are in 0.01 degress Celsius a base period from 1951-1980. The best estimate for the global mean temperature given by NASA is 14.0 deg C, so by finding the average annual anomoly, which will be the change in temperature from the base period, one can calculate an estimate for the average temperature of tha year. The results from the analysis of the data will give a picture of the trend in which global temperature has benn increasing and by how much.
